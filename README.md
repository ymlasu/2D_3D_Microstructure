# 2D_3D_Microstructure



The codes are used for simultaneously reconstructing microstructure and material property fields of random heterogeneous materials with multiple phases.
The codes are also suitable for strongly non-Gaussian random fields simulation.

The codes are freely distributed as complementary material to the article: Y. Gao, Y. Jiao, Y. Liu, Ultra-efficient reconstruction of 3D microstructure 
and distribution of properties of random heterogeneous materials containing multiple phases, Acta Mater. 204 (2021) 116526.
